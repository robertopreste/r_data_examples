## Loading the data  

This data come from the US Department of Agriculture and report a set of food nutrient information. These data were made available by Ashley Williams in JSON format, where each food has a number of identifying attributes along with two lists of nutrients and portion sizes.  

```{r}
path <- "datasets/usda_food/database.json"
db <- as_tibble(fromJSON(path, flatten = T))
```

```{r}
head(db)
```

Some of the features in this dataset are actually nested dataframes, as in `nutrients`.  

```{r}
db[[1, "nutrients"]]
```

Without going too much in details, let's grep a subset of these information by selecting the `id`, `description`, `group` and `manufacturer` columns. In addition, we will rename the `description` and `group` columns to `food` and `fgroup`, respectively.  

```{r}
info <- db %>% 
    select(id, description, group, manufacturer) %>% 
    rename(food = description, fgroup = group)
```

Now let's see the distribution of food groups.  

```{r}
info %>% count(fgroup, sort = T)
```

Let's collect all of the nutrients into a single dataframe. First we will create a vector with the ids that will then be added to each nutrient dataframe.  

```{r}
ids <- c()
for (elem in db$id) {
    ids <- append(ids, rep(elem, dim(subset(db, id == elem)[["nutrients"]][[1]])[1]))
}
```

```{r}
nutr_rows <- bind_rows(db$nutrients)
```

```{r}
nutrients <- 
    bind_cols(id = ids, nutr_rows) %>% 
    rename(nutrient = description, nutgroup = group)
```

Now we can merge the previously created `info` dataframe with `nutrients`.  

```{r}
ndata <- full_join(info, nutrients, by = "id")
```

Let's calculate median values by food group and nutrient type.  

```{r}
result <- ndata %>% 
    group_by(nutrient, fgroup) %>% 
    summarise(quant = median(value))
```

Now we can view which foods contain most Zinc.  

```{r}
result %>% 
    filter(nutrient == "Zinc, Zn") %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = reorder(fgroup, quant), y = quant, fill = fgroup)) + 
    geom_col() + 
    coord_flip() + 
    guides(fill = F) + 
    labs(x = "Food group", y = "Median value", title = "Median Zinc content")
```

We can also check which food is most dense in each nutrient.  

```{r}
by_nutrient <- ndata %>% 
    group_by(nutgroup, nutrient) %>% 
    summarise(max_value = max(value))
```
