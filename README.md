R Data Examples
===============

This repo contains a series of examples of data analysis and visualisation from the book [Python for Data Analysis](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781491957653/), but reproduced using R!

Examples come from Chapter 14 of the book, which provides very useful applications of some Python modules like `pandas` and `matplotlib` to load, wrangle, manipulate and visualise data.

Background
----------

I've loved *Python for Data Analysis* (and its author [Wes McKinney](http://wesmckinney.com)!), as it taught me many of the techniques that I use daily when working with data using Python. This book was my very first dive into Data Science, and after having read it (repeatedly) I kept on studying this topic, and eventually approached the R programming language. After some more studying (and earning a [Coursera specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/XQJQCG2DM6L5)!), I felt confident enough to reproduce the data analysis examples from *Python for Data Science* using R, so here we are.
This also reflects my thoughts about ending the well-known war between Python and R, since I think they've both grown to be almost interchangeable, especially for Data Science.
