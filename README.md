R Data Examples
===============

This repo contains a series of examples of data analysis and visualisation from the book [Python for Data Analysis](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781491957653/), but reproduced using R!

Examples come from Chapter 14 of the book, which provides very useful applications of some Python modules like `pandas` and `matplotlib` to load, wrangle, manipulate and visualise data.

I highly recommend [buying Python for Data Analysis](http://amzn.to/2vvBijB), because it offers an extensive overview of tools and techniques to manipulate, process and more generally analyse data using Python.

Background
----------

I've loved **Python for Data Analysis** (and its author [Wes McKinney](http://wesmckinney.com)!), as it taught me many of the techniques that I use daily when working with data using Python. This book was my very first dive into Data Science, and after having read it (repeatedly) I kept on studying this topic, and eventually approached the R programming language.

After some more studying (and earning a [Coursera specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/XQJQCG2DM6L5)!), I felt confident enough to reproduce the data analysis examples from **Python for Data Analysis** using R, so here we are.

This also reflects my thoughts about ending the well-known war between Python and R, since I think they've both grown to be almost interchangeable, especially for Data Science.

Usage
-----

There are different options to view the documents, pick the one you like most!

-   Each of these examples was developed as an R Markdown document, `knit`ted to a `github_document`, so you can simply open the `.md` file right from GitHub.

-   If you clone the repo locally, you can view a static HTML version of the notebooks by opening the `.nb.html` files in your browser.

-   Each example is also available as a Jupyter notebook, so you can click on the **launch binder** button above to launch a [Binder](https://mybinder.org) session, which allows to play with the examples interactively.

### Datasets

All data used for these examples come straight from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book) for the book **Python for Data Analysis** and are provided here for simplicity. The only exception is the dataset for the Federal Election Commission example, which is downloaded on the fly from the book repo because it is too big to host on GitHub now.

Disclaimer
----------

I am extremely thankful to Wes McKinney and O'Reilly for this great book, and all props go to these people.

I only took the liberty to reproduce some of its data analysis examples using a different programming language, so I guess/hope that no copyright infringement was made. I also release this code under the MIT License, as in the original repository.

If you want to support good science, you should really [buy Python for Data Analysis](http://amzn.to/2vvBijB) and give it a go.
